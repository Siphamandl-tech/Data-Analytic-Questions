Describe the most crucial first steps when developing a visualization. The most important first steps when developing a visualization are identifying the audience and understanding their needs. If you don't know who will use a visualization or understand its purpose, your creation will have a limited impact.

Compare reports and dashboards. Reports are static documents that are distributed physically or electronically. As static documents, they reflect data at the time of creation. Dashboards are dynamic and encourage data exploration. Typically delivered as a web interface, dashboards can integrate real-time data and enable users to explore segment data along multiple dimensions.

Identify the best type of chart for a given scenario. Given a specific scenario, select the type of chart that is most appropriate. Bar and pie charts work well for categorical data, whereas line charts are excellent for illustrating the relationship between two variables. Scatter charts show all of the points in a data set, whereas bubble charts use size to show the effect of a third numeric attribute. Maps are good for spatial data, waterfall charts show positive and negative impacts over time, and infographics convey a message. A word cloud is an optimal choice for displaying the relative significance of words when dealing with unstructured data.

Identify the type of report that should be used in a given scenario. Given a specific scenario, identify the type of report that would meet the requirement. For example, you need a recurring report on a regular schedule to meet various compliance objectives. On the other hand, self-service reports enable individuals to answer a specific question at the time of their choosing.

Describe considerations for maintaining data security. When working with static reports, having tight control over how reports get distributed is one approach to ensuring the security of the data in the report. Dashboards are more complicated, as they are accessible in an interactive manner. Work closely with information security and application administrators to map people's various roles to the appropriate dashboard sections. Restrict sensitive data access only to the functions that require it.
